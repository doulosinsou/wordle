# Wordle Solver/Helper
Luke Moyer 2022

This is a Worlde helper and game designed to solve the popular Wordle game. It is not connected in any way to the popular webapp. It uses custom logic to deduce the best words at each round until you win. This has a 100% win rate on current wordset (NYT wordset Feb 2022). You can use it alongside the real game and give prompts to find the next best word. You can also play against the program unlimited times. 

_Dependencies_: Default Python libraries

_Run_: Terminal `python3 play_wordle.py`
